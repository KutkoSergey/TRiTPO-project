"Tetriminos" are game pieces shaped like tetrominoesgeometric shapes composed of four
 square blocks each.A random sequence of Tetriminos fall down the playing field
 (a rectangular vertical shaft, called the "well" or "matrix"). The objective of
 the game is to manipulate  these Tetriminos, by moving each one sideways (if  player 
feels the need) and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a
 horizontal line often units without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, 
and any block above the deleted line will fall. When a certain number of lines are cleared, 
the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the Tetriminos
 to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of Tetriminos reaches the top of the
 playing field and no new Tetriminos are ableto enter. Some games also end after a finite
 number of levels or lines. All of the Tetriminos are capable of single and double clears.
I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I Tetrimino has the capacity to clear four 
lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a "tetris". (This may vary depending on the 
rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in 
the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations,[10] certain situations 
allow T, S, and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples
